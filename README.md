COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME:BIRUNTHA.M

DOMAIN:DATA ANALYSIS

DURATION:6 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

This repository demonstrate a workflow for analysing predictive classification using machine learning.
      
IDLE:Visual Studio Code,Jupyter Note Book
TOOLS USED:Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Scikit learn
DATASET SOURCE:Kaggle

OVERVIEW:

This project outlines the steps involved in:

1.Data Collection: Collect a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between spam and ham messages.​

2.Data Preprocessing:Performing essential data cleaning tasks such as:
         *Label datas(ham and spam)
         *Check missing values
         *Drop missing values

3.Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using label encoding.

4.Model Selection: Train machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes on the processed data.​

5.Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, often employing cross-validation to ensure robustness.

6.Accuracy:Our model achieved 99% accuracy on the test set.
